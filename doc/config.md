# pg_doorman.toml

## Description

The configuration file is in ["toml" format](https://toml.io/).
Some parameters MUST be specified in the configuration file (pg_doorman will not start without it), despite their default values.
For example, you MUST specify a admin username and password to access the administrative console.

## Generic settings

### host

Listen host (TCP v4 only).

Default: `"0.0.0.0"`.

### port

Listen port for incoming connections.

Default: `6432`.

### backlog

TCP backlog for incoming connections. A value of zero sets the `max_connections` as value for the TCP backlog.

Default: `0`.

### max_connections

The maximum number of clients that can connect to the pooler simultaneously. When this limit is reached:
* A client connecting without SSL will receive the expected error (code: `53300`, message: `sorry, too many clients already`).
* A client connecting via SSL will see a message indicating that the server does not support the SSL protocol.

Default: `8192`.

### tls_private_key

It is necessary to allow the processing of incoming connections from TLS clients.

Default: `None`.

### tls_certificate

It is necessary to allow the processing of incoming connections from TLS clients.

Default: `None`.

### tls_rate_limit_per_second

Limit the number of simultaneous attempts to create a TLS session.
Any value other than zero implies that there is a queue through which clients must pass in order to establish a TLS connection.
In some cases, this is necessary in order to launch an application that opens many connections at startup (the so-called "hot start").

Default: `0`.

### daemon_pid_file

Enabling this setting enables daemon mode. Comment this out if you want to run pg_doorman in the foreground with `-d`.

Default: `None`.

### syslog_prog_name

When specified, pg_doorman starts sending messages to syslog (using /dev/log or /var/run/syslog).
Comment this out if you want to log to stdout.

Default: `None`.

### log_client_connections 

Log client connections and disconnections for monitoring.

Default: `true`.

### log_client_disconnections 

Log client connections and disconnections for monitoring.

Default: `true`.

### worker_threads

The number of worker processes (posix threads) that async serve clients, which affects the performance of pg_doorman.
The more workers there are, the faster the system works, but only up to a certain limit (cpu count).
If you already have a lot of workers, you should consider increasing the number of virtual pools.

Default: `4`.

### worker_cpu_affinity_pinning

Automatically assign workers to different CPUs (man 3 cpu_set).

Default: `true`.

### virtual_pool_count

Increasing the number of virtual pools can help deal with internal latches that occur when processing very large numbers of fast queries.
It is strongly recommended not to change this parameter if you do not understand what you are doing.

Default: `1`.

### tokio_global_queue_interval 

[Tokio runtime settings](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/).
It is strongly recommended not to change this parameter if you do not understand what you are doing.

Default: `5`.

### tokio_event_interval

[Tokio runtime settings](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/).
It is strongly recommended not to change this parameter if you do not understand what you are doing.

Default: `1`.

### worker_stack_size

[Tokio runtime settings](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/).
It is strongly recommended not to change this parameter if you do not understand what you are doing.

Default: `8388608`.


### connect_timeout

Connection timeout to server in milliseconds.

Default: `2000` (2 sec).

### idle_timeout

Server idle timeout in milliseconds.

Default: `300000` (5 min).

### server_lifetime

Server lifetime in milliseconds.

Default: `300000` (5 min).

### server_round_robin

In transactional pool mode, we can choose whether the last free server backend will be used or the next one will be selected.
By default, the LRU (Least Recently Used) method is used, which has a positive impact on performance.

Default: `false`.

### sync_server_parameters

If enabled, we strive to restore the parameters (via query `SET`) that were set by the client (and application_name)
in transaction mode in other server backends. By default, this is disabled (false) due to performance.
If you need to know `application_name`, but don't want to experience performance issues due to constant server queries `SET`,
you can consider creating a separate pool for each application and using the `application_name` parameter in the `pool` settings.

Default: `false`.

### tcp_so_linger

By default, pg_doorman send `RST` instead of keeping the connection open for a long time.

Default: `0`.

### tcp_no_delay

TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle's algorithm for lower latency.

Default: `true`.

### tcp_keepalives_count

Keepalive enabled by default and overwrite OS defaults.

Default: `5`.

### tcp_keepalives_idle

Default: `5`.

### tcp_keepalives_interval

Default: `1`.

### unix_socket_buffer_size

Buffer size for read and write operations when connecting to PostgreSQL via a unix socket.

Default: `1048576`.

### admin_username

Access to the virtual admin database is carried out through the administrator's username and password.

Default: `"admin"`.

### admin_password

Access to the virtual admin database is carried out through the administrator's username and password.
It should be replaced with your secret.

Default: `"admin"`.

### prepared_statements

Switcher to enable/disable caching of prepared statements.

Default: `true`.

### prepared_statements_cache_size

Cache size of prepared requests on the server side.

Default: `8192`.

### message_size_to_be_stream

Data responses from the server (message type 'D') greater than this value will be
transmitted through the proxy in small chunks (1 MB).

Default: `1048576`.

### max_memory_usage

We calculate the total amount of memory used by the internal buffers for all current queries.
If the limit is reached, the client will receive an error (256 MB).

Default: `268435456`.

### shutdown_timeout

With a graceful shutdown, we wait for transactions to be completed within this time limit (10 seconds).

Default: `10000`.

### hba

The list of IP addresses from which it is permitted to connect to the pg-doorman.

### pooler_check_query

This query will not be sent to the server if it is run as a SimpleQuery.
It can be used to check the connection at the application level.

Default: `;`.

## Pools

Each record in the pool is the name of the virtual database that the pg-doorman client can connect to.

```toml
[pools.exampledb] # Declaring the 'exampledb' database
```

### server_host 

The directory with unix sockets or the IPv4 address of the PostgreSQL server that serves this pool.

Example: `"/var/run/postgresql"` or `"127.0.0.1"`.

### server_port

The port through which PostgreSQL server accepts incoming connections.

Default: `5432`.

### server_database 

Optional parameter that determines which database should be connected to on the PostgreSQL server.

Example: `"exampledb-2"`

### application_name

Parameter application_name, is sent to the server when opening a connection with postgresql.
It may be useful with the sync_server_parameters = false.

Example: "exampledb-pool".

### pool_mode

* `session`
:   Server is released back to pool after client disconnects.

* `transaction`
:   Server is released back to pool after transaction finishes.

Example: `"session"` or `"transaction"`.

### log_client_parameter_status_changes

Log information about any SET command in the log.

Default: `false`.

## Pool users

```toml
[pools.exampledb.users.0]
username = "exampledb-user-0" # A virtual user who can connect to this virtual database.
```
### username

A virtual username who can connect to this virtual database (pool).

Example: `"exampledb-user-0"`.

### password

The password for the virtual pool user.
Password can be specified in `MD5`, `SCRAM-SHA-256`, or `JWT` format.
Also, you can create a mirror list of users using secrets from the PostgreSQL instance: `select usename, passwd from pg_shadow`.

Example: `md5dd9a0f2...76a09bbfad` or `SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:E+QNCSW3r58yM+Twj1P5Uw==$LQrKl...Ro1iBKM=` or in jwt format: `jwt-pkey-fpath:/etc/pg_doorman/jwt/public-exampledb-user.pem`

### server_username

The real server user of the database who connects to this database.

Example: `"exampledb_server_user"`.

### server_password

The password (plain text) of real server user of the database who connects to this database.

Example: `"password"`.

### pool_size

The maximum number of simultaneous connections to the PostgreSQL server available for this pool and user.

Example: `40`.
