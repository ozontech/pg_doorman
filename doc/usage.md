## Description

**pg_doorman** is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any application can consider connection to **pg_doorman** as if it were a 
connection to Postgresql server. **pg_doorman** will create a connection to the actual server or will reuse an existed connection.

In order not to compromise transaction semantics for connection  pooling, **pg_doorman** supports several types of pooling when rotating connections:

* Session pooling
:   Client gets an assigned server connection for the lifetime of the client connection.
    After the client disconnects, server connection will be released back into the pool.

* Transaction pooling
:   Client gets an assigned server connection only for the duration of transaction.
    After PgDoorman notices the end of the transaction, connection will be released back into the pool.

The administration interface of **pg_doorman** consists of some new `SHOW` commands available when connected to a special "virtual"
database **pgbouncer** or **pgdoorman**.

## Quick-start

Basic setup and usage is as follows.

1. Create a pg_doorman.toml file.  Details in [config.md](config.md). Simple example:

    ```toml
        [general]
        host = "0.0.0.0"
        port = 6432
        
        admin_username = "admin"
        admin_password = "admin"
        
        [pools]
        
        [pools.exampledb]
        server_host = "127.0.0.1"
        server_port = 5432
        pool_mode = "transaction"
        
        [pools.exampledb.users.0]
        pool_size = 40
        username = "doorman"
        password = "SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:6nD+Ppi9rgaNyP7...MBiTld7xJipwG/X4="
    ```

2. Launch **pg_doorman**:

        $ pg_doorman pg_doorman.toml

3. Have your application (or the **psql** client) connect to
   **pg_doorman** instead of directly to the PostgreSQL server:

        $ psql -p 6432 -U doorman exampledb

4. Manage **pg_doorman** by connecting to the special administration
   database **pgdoorman** and issuing `SHOW HELP;` to begin:

        $ psql -p 6432 -U admin pgdoorman
			pgdoorman=> show help;
			NOTICE:  Console usage
			DETAIL:
				SHOW HELP|CONFIG|DATABASES|POOLS|POOLS_EXTENDED|CLIENTS|SERVERS|USERS|VERSION
				SHOW LISTS
				SHOW CONNECTIONS
				SHOW STATS
				RELOAD
				SHUTDOWN
			SHOW

5. If you made changes to the pg_doorman.toml file, you can reload it with:

        pgdoorman=# RELOAD;

## Command line switches

* `-d`, `--daemon`
:   Run in the background. Without it, the process will run in the foreground.

    In daemon mode, setting `daemon_pid_file` as well as `syslog_prog_name`
    is required.  No log messages will be written to stderr after
    going into the background.

* `-l`, `--log-level`
:   Set log-level: `INFO` or `DEBUG` or `WARN`.

* `-F`, `--log-format`
:   Possible values: text, structured, debug.

* `-n`, `--no-color`
:   Disable colors in the log output.

* `-V`, `--version`
:   Show version.

* `-h`, `--help`
:   Show short help.


## Admin console

The console is available by connecting as normal to the
database **pgdoorman** or **pgbouncer**:

    $ psql -p 6432 pgdoorman

Only user `admin_username` are allowed to log in to the console.

The admin console currently only supports the simple query protocol.
Some drivers use the extended query protocol for all commands; these
drivers will not work for this.

### Show commands

The **SHOW** commands output information. Each command is described below.

#### SHOW STATS

    of the wait times for clients assigned a backend during the current
    `15 seconds`).

#### SHOW SERVERS

* `server_id`
:   Unique ID for server.

* `server_process_id`
:   PID of backend server process.  In case connection is made over
    Unix socket and OS supports getting process ID info, its

:   Total number of processed transactions.

* `query_count`
:   Total number of processed queries.

* `age_seconds`
:   Lifetime of the current client connection.


#### SHOW POOLS

A new pool entry is made for each couple of (database, user).

* `database`
:   Database name.

* `user`
:   User name.

* `pool_mode`
:   The pooling mode in use.

* `cl_active`

* `sv_idle`
:   Server connections that are unused and immediately usable for client queries.

* `sv_login`
:   Server connections currently in the process of logging in.

* `maxwait`
:   How long the first (oldest) client in the queue has waited, in seconds.
    If this starts increasing, then the current pool of servers does
    not handle requests quickly enough.  The reason may be either an overloaded
    server or just too small of a **pool_size** setting.

* `maxwait_us`
:   Microsecond part of the maximum waiting time.

#### SHOW USERS

* `name`
:   The user name

* `pool_mode`
:   The pooling mode in use.

#### SHOW DATABASES

* `database`
:   Name of configured database entry.

* `host`
:   Host pg_doorman connects to.

* `port`
:   Port pg_doorman connects to.

* `pool_size`
:   Maximum number of server connections.

* `min_pool_size`
:   Minimum number of server connections.

* `reserve_pool_size`
:   Maximum number of additional connections for this database.

* `pool_mode`
:   The pooling mode in use.

* `max_connections`
:   Maximum number of allowed server connections for this database, as set by
    **max_db_connections**, either globally or per database.

* `current_connections`
:   Current number of server connections for this database.

#### SHOW SOCKETS

Shows low-level information about sockets or only active sockets.
This includes the information shown under **SHOW CLIENTS** and **SHOW
SERVERS** as well as other more low-level information.


#### SHOW VERSION

Show the PgDoorman version string.

#### SHUTDOWN

The PgDoorman process will exit.

#### RELOAD

The PgDoorman process will reload its configuration files and update
changeable settings.

PgDoorman notices when a configuration file reload changes the
connection parameters of a database definition.  An existing server
connection to the old destination will be closed when the server
connection is next released (according to the pooling mode), and new
server connections will immediately use the updated connection
parameters.


### Signals

* SIGHUP
:   Reload config. Same as issuing the command **RELOAD** on the console.

* SIGTERM
:   Immediate shutdown.

* SIGINT
:   Graceful shutdown [looks here](binary_upgrade.md) for more information.
