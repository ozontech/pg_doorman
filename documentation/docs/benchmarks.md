# Performance Benchmarks

## Automated Benchmark Results

Last updated: 2026-01-11 22:15 UTC

These benchmarks are automatically generated by the CI pipeline using `pgbench`.

### Test Environment

- **Pool size**: 40 connections
- **Test duration**: 30 seconds per test
- **Workers**: pg_doorman and odyssey use 4 workers
- **Started**: 2026-01-11 21:08:00 UTC
- **Finished**: 2026-01-11 22:15:39 UTC
- **Total duration**: 1h 7m 39s

### Legend

- **Value > 1.0**: pg_doorman is faster than competitor
- **Value = 1.0**: Equal performance
- **Value < 1.0**: pg_doorman is slower than competitor
- **∞**: Competitor failed (0 TPS), pg_doorman wins
- **N/A**: Test not supported by this pooler
- **-**: Test not executed

### Notes

- Odyssey has poor support for extended query protocol in transaction pooling mode, resulting in significantly lower performance compared to pg_doorman and pgbouncer
- **Important**: The values shown are **relative performance ratios**, not absolute TPS numbers. While absolute TPS values may vary depending on hardware and system load, the relative ratios between poolers should remain consistent when tests are run sequentially in a short timeframe (30 seconds each). This allows for fair comparison across different connection poolers under identical conditions
