# Performance Benchmarks

## Automated Benchmark Results

Last updated: 2026-01-11 11:53 UTC

These benchmarks are automatically generated by the CI pipeline using `pgbench`.

### Test Environment

- **Pool size**: 40 connections
- **Test duration**: 30 seconds per test
- **Workers**: pg_doorman and odyssey use 4 workers

### Results (Relative Performance: pg_doorman / competitor)

### Legend

- **Value > 1.0**: pg_doorman is faster than competitor
- **Value = 1.0**: Equal performance
- **Value < 1.0**: pg_doorman is slower than competitor
- **∞**: Competitor failed (0 TPS), pg_doorman wins
- **N/A**: Test not supported by this pooler
- **-**: Test not executed

### Test Types

- **Simple Protocol**: Basic query execution
- **Extended Protocol**: Parse/Bind/Execute flow
- **Prepared Protocol**: Uses prepared statements
- **Reconnect**: New connection per transaction (`--connect` flag)
- **SSL**: TLS encrypted connections

### Notes

- Odyssey does not support prepared statements in transaction pooling mode
- Odyssey has poor support for extended query protocol in transaction pooling mode, resulting in significantly lower performance compared to pg_doorman and pgbouncer
- Results may vary based on hardware and system load
