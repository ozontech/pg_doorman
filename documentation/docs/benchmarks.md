# Performance Benchmarks

## Automated Benchmark Results

Last updated: 2026-02-04 08:38 UTC

These benchmarks are automatically generated by the CI pipeline using `pgbench`.

### Test Environment

- **Pool size**: 40 connections
- **Test duration**: 30 seconds per test
- **Instance**: AWS Fargate (16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM)
- **Workers**: pg_doorman: 12, odyssey: 12
- **pgbench jobs**: 4 (global override)
- **Started**: 2026-02-04 07:15:48 UTC
- **Finished**: 2026-02-04 08:38:55 UTC
- **Total duration**: 1h 23m 7s

### Legend

- **+N%**: pg_doorman is N% faster than competitor (e.g., +10% means pg_doorman is 10% faster)
- **-N%**: pg_doorman is N% slower than competitor (e.g., -10% means pg_doorman is 10% slower)
- **≈0%**: Equal performance (difference less than 3%)
- **∞**: Competitor failed (0 TPS), pg_doorman wins
- **N/A**: Test not supported by this pooler
- **-**: Test not executed

### Notes

- Odyssey has poor support for extended query protocol in transaction pooling mode, resulting in significantly lower performance compared to pg_doorman and pgbouncer
- **Important**: The values shown are **relative performance ratios**, not absolute TPS numbers. While absolute TPS values may vary depending on hardware and system load, the relative ratios between poolers should remain consistent when tests are run sequentially in a short timeframe (30 seconds each). This allows for fair comparison across different connection poolers under identical conditions
